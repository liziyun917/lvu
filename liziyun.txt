Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I¡¯m OK
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
